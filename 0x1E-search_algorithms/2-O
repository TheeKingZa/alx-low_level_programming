/* Function description: This function implements a linear search algorithm.
 * It has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the size of the input array.
 * The algorithm iterates through each element in the array until a match is found.
 * Parameters:
 *   - array: The input array to be searched.
 *   - size: The size of the array.
 *   - target: The element to search for.
 * Returns: The index of the target element if found, otherwise -1.
