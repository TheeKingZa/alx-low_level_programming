## What are Make and Makefiles?

Make is a build automation tool used in software development to compile and build programs from source code. Makefiles are configuration files used by Make to define how the program should be built.

## When, Why, and How to Use Makefiles?

### When:
Makefiles are used when you have a project with multiple source files, and you want to automate the build process.

### Why:
Makefiles make it easy to manage complex projects with many dependencies, and they ensure that only the necessary files are recompiled when changes are made.

### How:
To use Makefiles, you create a file named "Makefile" or "makefile" in your project directory, defining the rules for building your project.

## What Are Rules and How to Set and Use Them?

In a Makefile, rules define how to build specific targets. A rule typically consists of a target, prerequisites, and commands.

```make
target: prerequisites
    commands

* Target: The file or action you want to build.
* Prerequisites: The files or actions that the target depends on.
* Commands: The actions to execute for building the target.

What Are Explicit and Implicit Rules?
Explicit Rules:
Explicit rules are defined in the Makefile and specify how to build a target directly. You provide the recipe for building the target.

Implicit Rules:
Implicit rules are built-in rules that Make uses when there is no explicit rule for a target. They are predefined for common file types, like C source files.

What Are the Most Common/Useful Rules?
Some common and useful rules in a Makefile include:

ieeded. include this in your project's documentation and adapt it as
-bash: bad substitution: no closing "`" in `make
target: prerequisites
    commands

* Target: The file or action you want to build.
* Prerequisites: The files or actions that the target depends on.
* Commands: The actions to execute for building the target.

Implicit Rules:

What Are the Most Common/Useful Rules?
Some common and useful rules in a Makefile include:

* all : Builds the entire project.
* clean : Remove generated files.
* install : Installs the program.
* test : Runs tests
* help : Displays help information.

What Are Variables and How to Set and Use Them?
Variables in Makefiles allow you to store values that can be reused throughout the file. You can set and use variables as follows:

==make==
--Code--

CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -O2

target: prerequisites
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@

-----

* CC : Compiler executable.
* CFLAGS : Compiler flags.

By using variables, you can make your Makefile more flexible and easier to maintain.

This README provides an overview of Make and Makefiles, their use cases, rules, and variables. For detailed instructions and examples, refer to the project's specific Makefile.

This README should give users a good starting point for understanding Make and Makefiles, how to use them, and the key concepts involved. You can include this in your project's documentation and adapt it as needed.
