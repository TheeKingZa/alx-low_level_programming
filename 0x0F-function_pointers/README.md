What are function pointers and how to use them
What does a function pointer exactly hold
Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory?


Function pointers are variables that store the memory address of a function. They allow you to treat functions as data, which means you can pass functions as arguments to other functions, return functions from functions, and store functions in data structures like arrays or linked lists.

Here's an example of how to declare a function pointer in C/C++:

return_type (*ptr_name)(parameter_list);


-----

Let's break down the syntax:

return_type is the return type of the function the pointer will be pointing to.
ptr_name is the name of the function pointer variable.
parameter_list is the list of parameters that the function the pointer will be pointing to accepts.
To assign a function to a function pointer, you simply assign the address of the function to the pointer variable. Here's an example:

int add(int a, int b) {
    return (a + b);
}

int (*ptr)(int, int); /* Declare a function pointer */
ptr = &add; /* Assign the address of the "add" function to the pointer */

/* Call the function using the pointer */
int result = (*ptr)(4, 5);

------------
In the example above, the ptr function pointer is declared to point to a function that takes two int parameters and returns an int. It is then assigned the address of the add function using the & operator. Finally, the add function is called through the pointer by dereferencing it with *ptr and providing the arguments (4, 5).

A function pointer holds the memory address of a function, which is usually a specific location in the program's virtual memory. The exact location depends on the system and compiler implementation. The function pointer allows you to indirectly call the function at that memory address.

It's important to note that function pointers are specific to the programming language and are not directly related to virtual memory management. The concept of virtual memory and its organization is handled by the operating system and runtime environment, which manage the memory layout and provide mechanisms for mapping and accessing different sections of memory.
